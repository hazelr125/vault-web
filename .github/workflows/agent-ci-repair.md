description: Repairs failing CI on agent-managed pull requests automatically, at most twice per pull request.
intent: When CI fails on a pull request the agents opened, find the cause and push a fix to that pull request's branch, at most twice, and hand back to a human when two attempts were not enough. Never touch main.

  # Deterministic gates, evaluated before the agent runs:

  #   2. it must not already have used its final attempt (agent-reentry-2)

# CI Repair

CI failed in `Vault-Web/vault-web` on a pull request opened by the coding agent.
Find why CI failed and fix the cause on that pull request's branch.

The failed run is ${{ github.event.workflow_run.html_url }}, on commit
`${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_sha }}`. First find the open pull request
whose head is that commit — you have it checked out — and use its number for every
output you emit.

## Attempt counter

Read the labels on that pull request.

- No `agent-reentry-*` label → this is attempt 1. Add `agent-reentry-1` before you
  finish.
- `agent-reentry-1` → this is attempt 2, your last. Remove `agent-reentry-1` and
  add `agent-reentry-2` before you finish.

You will never see a pull request that already carries `agent-reentry-2`: the
workflow refuses to start in that case, before you are invoked. After a second
failed attempt a maintainer takes over — say so in your comment.

## What to do

Read the failing job logs. Find the actual cause — a compilation error, a failing
test, a formatting violation that Spotless or Prettier rejects.

Fix the cause, not the symptom. Do not delete or skip a failing test to make CI
green: if a test fails because the code is wrong, fix the code. If you believe the
test itself is wrong, say so in a comment and stop rather than changing it.

Keep the change as small as the failure requires, and push it to the pull
request's own branch.

## Limits

Do not touch anything unrelated to the failure. Never push to `main`. Do not
merge. Do not change workflow files. If you cannot determine the cause, comment
with what you found and stop — a clear "I could not fix this, here is why" is more
useful than a guess.
